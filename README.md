## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment
You will need to create your own virtual environment. Example using `venv`:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
